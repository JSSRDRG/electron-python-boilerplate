## Clone and run to start developing

This is a minimal Electron application boilerplate based on the Quick start Guide within the Electron documentation and Photon to hookup Python.

A Basic Electron Python application needs just these files:
* `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
* `main.py` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's main process.
* `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's renderer process.
